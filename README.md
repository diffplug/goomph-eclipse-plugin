# Goomph eclipse plugin example

This is an example project for using the [goomph](https://github.com/diffplug/goomph) gradle plugin to create an eclipse plugin, using:

- Dependencies pulled from maven and p2
- Automatic OSGi metadata
- Generate IDE-as-build-artifact

It's a quick fork of [the Goomph and Eclipse RCP](https://github.com/diffplug/gradle_and_eclipse_rcp) example project, tweaked for an eclipse plugin.

### Quickstart

- `gradlew ide` opens an IDE for manipulating this project.
